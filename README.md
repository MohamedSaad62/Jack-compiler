This project is a part from How to build a modern computer from nand to tetris part 2 course. <br>
This is a two tear comiler like jave and python.<br>
Two tear compiler compile on two stages first it comile for intermediate language (Virtual machine language) then the intermediate language is compiled to machine code.<br>
This compiler compile form the jack language to the Virtual machine language.<br>
It take file.jack as argument input or a directory that have .jack files and generate .vm files.<br>
-How to use <br>
To use this compiler compile a jack file or directory contain jack files.<br>
Then you will find files.vm .<br>
load the .vm file or the directory that contain vm files to the VMemulator. <br>
You can get the VMemulator by downloand nand to tetris software suite from nand2tetris.org .<br>
And now you can run the code. <br>
